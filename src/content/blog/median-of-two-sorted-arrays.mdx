In this post, we'll delve into a straightforward solution to a classic problem often encountered in coding interviews of companies like 
Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook, which deal with massive amounts of data and require efficient algorithms for data processing and analysis. 
This approach is particularly efficient for large datasets since it achieves the optimal time complexity of `O(log (m+n))`

```typescript title="example.ts" {2-4}
const lenSum: number = nums1.length + nums2.length;
const medianPos: number = Math.floor(lenSum / 2);
const isCombinedLenEven: boolean = !(lenSum % 2);

let mergedArr: number[] = [];
```
```sh frame="code"
#!/bin/sh
# my-script.sh
echo "This is a script file, not a terminal!"
```

## Problem Statement

Given: Two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`
##### Example 1:

- Input: `nums1 = [1,3]`, `nums2 = [2]`
- Output: `2.00000`
- Explanation: merged array is `[1,2,3]` and median is `2`.
##### Example 2:
- Input: `nums1 = [1,2]`, `nums2 = [3,4]`
- Output: `2.50000`
- Explanation: merged array is `[1,2,3,4]` and median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`.

### Intuition and Approach
The solution leverages the simple idea that for the median we just have to look for the middle of the merged array of the two sorted arrays.
So we combine the two sorted arrays into one sorted array named `A`. 
- If the combined length `n` of these arrays is odd,the median is `A[n / 2]`.
- If n is even, the median is the average of `A[n / 2]` and `A[n / 2 + 1]`.

With that we can find the length of the two combined arrays as if they were merged and their median position.

```typescript title="example.ts" {2-4}
const lenSum: number = nums1.length + nums2.length;
const medianPos: number = Math.floor(lenSum / 2);
const isCombinedLenEven: boolean = !(lenSum % 2);

let mergedArr: number[] = [];
```
